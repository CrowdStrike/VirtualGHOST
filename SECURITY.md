# Security

This document outlines the security policy and procedures for projects under the CrowdStrike organization.

## Supported Versions

For each project, we aim to release security vulnerability patches for the most recent version at an accelerated cadence. Please refer to the specific project repository for details on supported versions.

## Reporting a Potential Security Vulnerability

We encourage the reporting of security-related vulnerabilities. To report a suspected vulnerability in any CrowdStrike project, please use one of the following methods:

+ Submitting an __issue__ to the relevant project repository.
+ Submitting a __pull request__ with a potential fix to the relevant project repository.
+ Sending an email to __oss-security@crowdstrike.com__.

## Disclosure and Mitigation Process

Upon receiving a security bug report, the issue will be triaged and assigned to a project maintainer. The maintainer will coordinate the fix and release process, typically involving:

+ Initial communication with the reporter to acknowledge receipt and provide status updates.
+ Confirmation of the issue and determination of affected versions.
+ Codebase audit to identify similar potential vulnerabilities.
+ Preparation of patches for all supported versions.
  + Patches will be submitted through pull requests, flagged as security fixes.
  + After merging and successful post-merge testing, patches will be released accordingly.

## Comments and Suggestions

We welcome suggestions for improving this process. Please share your ideas by creating an issue in the relevant project repository.
